Hey there fellow isabelle player! Isabelle's notebook was created in a few days, and is far from being perfect. It was initially thought and designed for 
personal use only (which is to say, it was poorly designed).

Upon getting to a usable state of the app, i eventually decided to make it public, so that i could get feedback on it.

Additionnaly, Isabelle's notebook uses a Google spreadsheet as a database, meaning that all the data displayed on the app comes from 
here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ePqzJlxj6JexMgIXOzJq99ENSXcvVWA0yTEttUhtI_M/edit?usp=sharing
I do not take credit for coming up with these numbers and stats, most of them come from the official isabelle discord server and the french isabelle discord server.

Anyone can edit this spreadsheet. If you lab something and want everyone to have access to the data you discovered, juste create a new column, 
and fill it for every character.
Please do not remove any previously created column, and do not touch the first and the second ones (name and fighter number).
This system heavily relies on every user's good will, so please be nice and don't mess up the spreadsheet :D

If you want to contact me, or have any questions regarding the way Isabelle's notebook works, here's my discord tag : theray1#3107

Finally, thank you to those who whill be using and contributing to the Isabelle's notebook.
